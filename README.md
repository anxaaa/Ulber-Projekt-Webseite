# Swiss Photography Project
This is a school project. The task was to create a website and to implement all legal aspects (such as imprint, cookies or general terms and conditions) on this website.

Therefore, I would like to point out that Swiss Photography is merely an invention and does not exist.

## How to open the website:
_This doesn't work on your phone!_

1. save this repository in your local storage

You can either clone this repository or donwload the zip file from it (if you download the zip file, don't forget to unzip it).

**Of course, this only works if node js is installed on your computer.
If this isn't the case, you must download and install it first.**

## How to install node js:
1. go to the node js website -> https://nodejs.org/de/ 
2. download the version of your choice
3. double click the downloaded file to open the installer and follow the instructions on your screen

4. open the terminal and type ```npm i```
